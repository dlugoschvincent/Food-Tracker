# Food Tracker #

This Application allows you to track meals that you ate. It shares a database of all the food that users submitted.
It features a bar code scanner which is used to add new food. 

If you want more info about all the features just press the exclamation mark in the nav bar.

## Run Local ##
You can run the application locally but you have to set environment variables for the supabase connection.
You can also run your own supabase instancee locally but I dont recommend it.

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```
or 
```bash
npm run dev
```
